# Building-Modern-Python-Applications-on-AWS

## Week 1

This week focuses on getting hands-on experience with the AWS SDK, specifically `boto3`, and applying it to real AWS services.

### Exploring AWS with Python
## Highlights
- Introduction to `boto3`, the AWS SDK for Python.
- Detailed examples of interacting with Amazon S3, including creating buckets, uploading files, and listing bucket contents.

## Project Structure
- `.py files` contain scripts demonstrating various S3 accessing operations.
- `README.md` provides an overview and guide to what's covered in this branch.

## Learning Objectives
In the week one course content, we should be able to:
- Utilize `boto3` to manage AWS services programmatically.
- Understand basic operations with Amazon S3 using Python.
- Configure AWS IAM for secure access to AWS services.

## Note
This repository is part of a personal educational project. I'm documenting my journey through the course and sharing the progress for informational purposes.
